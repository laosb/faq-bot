# faq-bot

This was the FAQ Bot used before 2021-08-15 in the HDUHelp QA Group (QQ). It was created by me with the intention of making a general use QQ bot software.

Following the retirement of the QQ bot I'm open-sourcing this early TypeScript piece of mine. I have no intention to continue this project so feel free to maintain a fork, if still relevant to you.

This bot doesn't interface with QQ but through [OneBot](https://github.com/botuniverse/onebot). This was hosted on Vercel Serverless and the OneBot interface was a self-hosted CoolQ, or an instance of [Go-CQHTTP](https://docs.go-cqhttp.org) when CoolQ was discontinued.

Private information has been replaced with `[REDACTED]`, which in many cases breaks the code from running, so if you decided to use, please search for `[REDACTED]` and replace with correct values accordingly.

This code is now released in [MIT](https://laosb.mit-license.org) and is not a property of HDUHelp or HDU, as it never was.
